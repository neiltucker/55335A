Courseware Access: 
https://www.softwaretutorialservices.com/course/55335a

Course Overview:
This lab intensive one-day course helps developers and database administrators to utilize the full potential of SQL Server Machine Learning Services using Python, R, and Java. Participants will gain hands-on experience by creating Machine Learning (ML) tasks on SQL Server to get more value from their data.

Audience:
Database administrators and developers who want to use ML tools on data residing in SQL Server databases. A basic knowledge of T-SQL and one of the three programming languages used for the labs (Python or R or Java) is recommended. This is a SQL Server Machine Learning course. Although some programming is necessary for some of the exercises, the focus of the material is the SQL Server ML service.

Learning Objectives:
After completing this course, students will be able to:
- Leverage Python, R, and Java for ML tasks within SQL Server
- Implement text analysis, natural language processing, and anomaly detection
- Develop image processing and computer vision solutions
- Create predictive analytics models integrated with SQL Server
- Apply time series forecasting techniques
- Optimize ML model performance within the database environment
- Implement security best practices for in-database ML services
- Understand the advantages of on-premises ML solutions
