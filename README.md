# 55335A - SQL Server Machine Learning using Python, R and Java

**Courseware Access:** [https://www.softwaretutorialservices.com/course/55335a](https://www.softwaretutorialservices.com/course/55335a)

This lab intensive one-day course helps database administrators, data scientists and developers to utilize the full potential of SQL Server Machine Learning Services using Python, R, and Java. Participants will gain hands-on experience by creating Machine Learning (ML) tasks on SQL Server to get more value from their data.  Some coding is done during the exercises, but the necessary scripts are provided with the student materials so students do not need prior programming experience.  The format of the class can be Instructor-led or Workshop.

## Prerequisites
- A basic knowledge of SQL
- A basic knowledge of command-line scripting (PowerShell, Shell or Batch)
- A basic knowledge of one of the programming languages (Python, R or Java)
- Working knowledge of SQL Server database management

## Audience
Data scientists, database administrators and developers who want to use ML tools on data residing in SQL Server databases.  A basic knowledge of T-SQL and one of the three programming languages used for the labs (Python or R or Java) is recommended.  This is a SQL Server Machine Learning course.  Although programming is necessary (and scripted) for some of the exercises, the focus of the material is the ML capabilities of SQL Server.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Leverage Python, R, and Java for ML tasks within SQL Server
- Implement text analysis, natural language processing, and anomaly detection
- Develop image processing and computer vision solutions
- Create predictive analytics models integrated with SQL Server
- Apply time series forecasting techniques
- Optimize ML model performance within the database environment
- Implement security best practices for in-database ML services
- Understand the advantages of on-premises ML solutions

This course empowers data professionals to extract maximum value from their datasets without the hassle of moving or copying data from its source. By learning to use Python, R, or Java to perform machine learning tasks directly on the SQL Server instance, students will unlock the full value of their data while gaining security, performance and efficient workflow advantages.
