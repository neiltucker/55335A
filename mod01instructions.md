### Lab 1: Configuring Machine Learning in SQL Server (2 hours)

#### General Instructions
- **Lab Files Location**: All scripts for this lab are located on the student computer in `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01`.
- **Execution Tips**:
  - **Do Not Execute Entire Scripts**: Review each script carefully and execute each commented section of code separately.
  - **Run as Administrator**: Run all applications (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or SSMS) as an administrator.

**Note**: SQL Server Machine Learning services have already been installed during the server setup. In this lab, you will verify and set up the runtime environments.

### Exercise 3: Register R Runtime with SQL Server
- **Objective**: Register the R runtime with SQL Server.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01\L1_3.ps1` in PowerShell ISE (Administrator).
  2. Review the script before running it.

---

### Exercise 4: Test R Runtime in SQL Server
- **Objective**: Verify that the R runtime is working in SQL Server.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01\L1_4.sql` in SSMS.
  2. Review and execute each section of code to test the R runtime using `sp_execute_external_script`.

### Exercise 6: Register Python Runtime with SQL Server
- **Objective**: Register the Python runtime with SQL Server.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01\L1_6.ps1` in PowerShell ISE (Administrator).
  2. Review the script before running it.

---

### Exercise 7: Test Python Runtime in SQL Server
- **Objective**: Verify that the Python runtime is working in SQL Server.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01\L1_7.sql` in SSMS.
  2. Review and execute each section of code to test the Python runtime.

---

### Exercise 9: Register Java Runtime with SQL Server
- **Objective**: Install the AdventureWorks2022 database and register the Java runtime with it.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Run `C:\Classfiles\AdventureWorks_Install.ps1` to install AdventureWorks2022.
  2. Open `C:\Classfiles\Labfiles\Mod01\L1_9.sql` in SSMS to register the Java runtime in the database.
  3. Review the script, then execute each section of code.

---

### Exercise 10: Test Java Runtime in SQL Server
- **Objective**: Verify that the Java runtime is working in SQL Server.
